### Abstract
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In this work we propose an effective preconditioning technique to accelerate the steady-state simulation of large-scale memristor crossbar arrays (MCAs). We exploit the structural regularity of MCAs to develop a specially-crafted preconditioner that can be efﬁciently evaluated utilizing tensor products and block matrix inversion. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed technique compared to mainstream preconditioners.
