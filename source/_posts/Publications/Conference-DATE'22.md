## Abstract

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Optimized model and energy-efficient hardware are both required for deep neural networks (DNNs) in edge-computing area. Neural architecture search (NAS) methods are employed for DNN model optimization with resulted multi-precision networks. Previous works have proposed low-precision-combination (LPC) and high-precision-split (HPS) methods for multi-precision networks, which are not energy-efficient for precision-scalable vector implementation. In this paper, a BSC-based vector systolic accelerator is developed for a precision-scalable energy-efficient convolution on edge. The maximum energy efficiency of the proposed BSC vector processing element (PE) is up to 1.95× higher in 2-bit, 4-bit and 8-bit operations when compared with LPC and HPS PEs. Further with NAS optimized multi-precision CNN networks, the averaged energy efficiency of the proposed vector systolic BSC PE array achieves up to 2.18× higher in 2bit, 4-bit and 8-bit operations than that of LPC and HPS PE arrays.
